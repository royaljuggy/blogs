# React Blog Application Setup Instructions

## 1. Run the application locally:
To see your blog in action on your local machine, navigate to the `react-blog` directory and run:
```bash
npm start
```
This will open the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 2. Create new blog posts:
*   All your blog posts are written in Markdown files.
*   Create new `.md` files inside the `src/blogs` directory (e.g., `src/blogs/my-new-post.md`).
*   Each Markdown file should start with "front matter" to define metadata like title, date, author, and description. For example:
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: My New Awesome Post
    date: 2026-01-03
    author: Your Name
    description: A brief summary of what this post is about.
    ---

    # My New Awesome Post

    This is the content of your new blog post...
    ```
*   The `Home.js` component automatically discovers blog posts. You will need to manually update the `blogFiles` array in `src/components/Home.js` to include your new post's `slug`, `title`, `date`, `author`, and `description`. This is a limitation for static sites and would typically be automated with a build script or CMS in a more complex setup. The `slug` should match the filename (without `.md`).

## 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
**Important:** The `homepage` property in `package.json` should only be set right before you deploy, as it can cause issues with the local development server.

1.  **Add `homepage` to `package.json`**: Before deploying, open `react-blog/package.json` and add a `homepage` property. It should look like this:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "react-blog",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "private": true,
      "homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>",
      "dependencies": { ... },
      ...
    }
    ```
    *   Replace `<your-github-username>` with your GitHub username.
    *   Replace `<your-repo-name>` with the name of your GitHub repository.
    *   **Example**: If your username is `octocat` and your repo is `my-blog`, the line should be `"homepage": "https://octocat.github.io/my-blog"`.

2.  **Deploy**: Once the `homepage` is set correctly, run the deploy command:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
    This command builds your app and pushes it to a `gh-pages` branch on GitHub. GitHub Pages will then serve your blog from that branch.

## 4. Initial Git Commit:
Before deploying, you should commit your changes to your Git repository.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup of React blog app with GitHub Pages deployment"
```
Then, you can create a new repository on GitHub, and push your local repository to it:
```bash
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
After pushing to `main`, you can then run `npm run deploy` to publish to GitHub Pages.
