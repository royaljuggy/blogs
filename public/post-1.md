# Welcome to My First Blog Post!

This is some *italic* text and some **bold** text.

Here's a list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And here's some code:
```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## Test
Welcome to my first blog post! Yes, here, the human is finally writing stuff instead of allowing vibe-coding to win :)

The purpose of this whole project is to have a "self-hosted" (okay not actually self-hosted but you get the idea) blog that I can post reviews or general thoughts I have.

This is somewhat of an extension of my previous project, which was my diary of my internship in Japan. Maybe I'll decide to port those over to here one day.

Anyways in 2026 I want to try making some blog posts that I'll use to convert into YouTube scripts and create videos for. Just a little passion project.
